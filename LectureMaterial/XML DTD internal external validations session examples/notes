PCDATA – parsed character data. It parse to all the data in an xml document.

Example:

<family>
    <mother>mom</mother>
    <father>dad</father>
</family>
Here, the family element contains 2 more elements “mother” and ”father”. So it parse further to get the text of mother and father to give the value of family as “mom dad”

CDATA – unparsed characted Data. This is the data that should not be parsed further in an xml document.

<family>
    <![CDATA[ 
       <mother>mom</mother>
       <father>dad</father>
    ]]>
</family>
Here, the value of family will be <mother>mom</mother><father>dad</father>.


From WIKI:

PCDATA

Simply speaking, PCDATA stands for Parsed Character Data. 
That means the characters are to be parsed by the XML, XHTML, or HTML parser. 
(&lt; will be changed to <, <p> will be taken to mean a paragraph tag, etc). 
Compare that with CDATA, where the characters are not to be parsed by the XML, XHTML, 
or HTML parser.

CDATA

The term CDATA, meaning character data, is used for distinct, but related purposes in the markup 
languages SGML and XML. The term indicates that a certain portion of the document is general 
character data, rather than non-character data or character data with a more specific, 
limited structure.
